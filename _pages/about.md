I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Groningen, supervised by Prof. [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/) and Dr. Mohamed Soliman. Before starting my Ph.D., I also obtained my Master Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen under the supervision of Prof. [Lambert Schomaker](https://www.ai.rug.nl/~lambert/
) and Dr. [Hamidreza Kasaei](https://hkasaei.github.io
).

My research mainly focuses on Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering, Technical Debt Management, and Mining Software Repositories.
