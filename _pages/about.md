I am currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Faculty of Science and Engineering at the University of Groningen, working under the supervision of Prof. [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/) and Dr. Mohamed Soliman. Prior to pursuing my doctorate, I earned a Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Groningen, where I was guided by Prof. [Lambert Schomaker](https://www.ai.rug.nl/~lambert/) and Prof. [Hamidreza Kasaei](https://hkasaei.github.io).

My research primarily revolves around Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering. In the course of my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in AI and computer science, allowing me to approach complex problems with innovative solutions. I am passionate about advancing the field of software engineering through the application of cutting-edge AI techniques.
