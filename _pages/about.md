I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at [University of Twente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Twente). My academic journey began with a Master’s Degree in Artificial Intelligence, under the guidance of Prof. [Hamidreza Kasaei](https://hkasaei.github.io) and Prof. [Lambert Schomaker](https://www.ai.rug.nl/~lambert/). I further cultivated my skills during my Ph.D. in Computer Science at [University of Groningen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Groningen), mentored by Prof. [Paris Avgeriou](http://www.cs.rug.nl/~paris/) and Dr. Mohamed Soliman. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor’s Degree in Software Engineering from [Southeast University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_University) (东南大学).

My research interests are centered around the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Software Engineering, and Cybersecurity. Over the years, I have built a robust foundation in AI and computer science, which has equipped me to tackle complex challenges with innovative solutions. I am driven by my passion to push the boundaries of software engineering and cybersecurity through the application of advanced AI techniques. Here are some of my projects:

- **Large Language Model for Cybersecurity**
  - Work In Progress

- **Software Maintainability: Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) Management**
  - Developers’ Perspectives and Management of SATD: [SEAA-2020](https://yikun-li.github.io/publications/SEAA2020.pdf), [TSE-2022](https://yikun-li.github.io/publications/TSE2022.pdf)
  - Identification of SATD in Multiple Sources: [EMSE-2021](https://yikun-li.github.io/publications/EMSE2022a.pdf), [EMSE-2022](https://yikun-li.github.io/publications/EMSE2022b.pdf)
  - SATD Relation Detection Across Various Sources: [TechDebt-2023](https://yikun-li.github.io/publications/TechDebt2023.pdf)
